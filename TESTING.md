# Testing the Tenable-Utility Script
Thank you for testing the Tenable-Utility script! This page will guide you through setting up the environment and running tests to ensure that the script functions as expected.
## Prerequisites
Before testing, please ensure the following:
- You are running the script on a Linux machine.
- You have root (sudo) access to run the script.
- Tenable.sc and Nessus are installed for full feature testing.

## Setting Up for Testing

cd Tenable-Utility
```
### 2. Make the Script Executable
```bash
chmod +x tenable_utility.sh
```
### 3. Running the Script
Run the script using sudo to ensure it has the necessary permissions:
```bash

If Tenable.sc or Nessus are not installed, the script will notify you of their status and certain functions will be unavailable for testing.

### 4. Test Cases
1. Test: Script Welcome Message
